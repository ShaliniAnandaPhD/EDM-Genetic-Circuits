 **Core Features Across Scripts** 🌟:
   - **Protein Sequence Input** 🧬: Users can input protein sequences either manually or by uploading a file. This flexibility allows for easy experimentation with different sequences.
   - **ESMFold Prediction** 🤖: The application communicates with the ESMFold API, sending the input sequence and retrieving a predicted protein structure in PDB format. This is where the magic of AI comes into play, predicting complex structures from simple sequences.
   - **Visualization** 🌐: Using `py3Dmol`, the predicted structure is beautifully rendered in 3D, offering various visualization styles and color schemes. It’s like bringing the protein to life on your screen!
   - **plDDT Score** 📊: Each script provides the plDDT score, indicating the confidence level in the predicted structure. This score is crucial for understanding the reliability of the predictions.

 **Specific Features in Each Script** 📑:
   - **esm9.py** 👓: Focuses on basic structure prediction and visualization, along with the ability to download the PDB file for further analysis.
   - **esm15.py** 🔍: Adds a layer of analysis with amino acid frequency visualization, offering more insights into the protein's composition.
   - **esm60.py** 🚀: Expands the horizon by including a hydrophobicity plot, essential for understanding protein interactions, and sequence validation to ensure accuracy.

**Upcoming Projects ** 🔬:
   - **Structure-Function Analysis** 🧩: Integrating this tool to study genetic circuits by predicting protein structures involved in these circuits can reveal intricate details about molecular interactions.

In summary, leveraging this tool for genetic circuit studies opens a world of possibilities, bridging the gap between protein structural prediction and functional genetic analysis 🌉. Understanding protein structures paves the way for groundbreaking discoveries in biotechnology and synthetic biology, making this field not just fascinating but also immensely impactful 🌍💡.
